                  <p>Rahiem's submission link does lead to a page with
                     links to the project1. Just name change to 'client project'
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the
                     file/folder names.

                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <p>The page does have sufficient contrast/font sizing
                           for easy readability for the most part but the footer could use
                           some bolder and larger font to make it easier to read.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The page does have site colors and fonts using the
                           standard .css file.
                        </p>
                     </li>

                        <ol>
                           <li>
                              <p>Contrast - There is good contrast on the page
                                 with the blue, white, and grey colors besides the
                                 aforementioned footer issue. The small white text in the
                                 footer does not have good enough contrast against the blue
                                 background.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Repetition - There is good repetition on the
                                 "Services" page with the grid of services. The header and
                                 footer also repeat on each page and are consistent.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Alignment - There is overall good alignment
                                 because most of the content is in the center of the page.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Proximity - The page needs some small tweaks on
                                 proximity. I would suggest having less padding above the
                                 heading on the "about us" page. It throws off the symmetry of
                                 the main blue box. Also, the "Services" page has the services
                                 text in boxes but is not centered vertically.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                        </ol>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The page technically has a header, main, and
                           footer but they are just div tags with classes. I would suggest
                           using the actual header, main, and footer tags.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The header technically has the brand name at the
                           top consistently but it is an icon and not a h1 with the text
                           "TEDDY'S AUTO SHOP" on all pages. I would suggest adding a h1
                           with the text "TEDDY'S AUTO SHOP" on all pages per the
                           assignment requirements.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The first thing in the main is a nav tag on all
                           the pages. I would suggest changing this so that the main on
                           each page begins with a h2 tag that has the name of the page.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The home.html page has a slogan on it "Mechanics
                           You Can Trust." but this slogan is not on every page in a
                           consistent location. I would suggest adding the existing slogan
                           to a consistent place on the other pages as well.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The footer is missing the validation links for CSS
                           and HTML on all pages.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Other missed requirements from client project part
                           2:

                        <ol>
                           <li>
                              <p>The home page is not using the header and footer
                                 tags in the order header, main, footer like the assignment
                                 asked.
                              </p>

                           <li>
                              <p>The home page is called home.html instead of
                                 index.html like the assignment requirements state.
                              </p>
