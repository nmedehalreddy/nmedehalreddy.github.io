                    <p>Helly's submission link does lead to a page with links to the Client Project. </p>

                    <p>The page looks good as there are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names. </p>

                            <p>The page does have sufficient contrast/font sizing for easy readability for the most part. </p>

                                    <p>Repetition - Nav pages are missing. I would suggest add missing pages.</p>

                                    <p>Alignment - There is overall good alignment because most of the content at center of the page and no horizontal scrolling. The footer alignment should be fixed to center. </p>
