                    <p>Rahiem's submission link does lead to a page with links to the project1. I would suggest change name 'Project 1' to 'client project'. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The page does have sufficient contrast/font sizing for easy readability for the most part but nav elements should have more space. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The page does have site colors and fonts using the standard .css file. </p>

                                    <p>Contrast - There is good contrast on the page with the black, white, and blue colors besides the aforementioned nav elements issue. The selected Nav element should have given new color so that it's different from other nav elements. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Repetition - There is good repetition on the header and footer also repeat on each page and are consistent. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Alignment - There is overall good alignment because most of the content at center of the page and no horizontal scrolling. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Proximity - The page needs some small tweaks on proximity. The related sites page image could have adjusted so that page has more visibility without scrolling. </p>

                            <p>The page has a header, main, and footer but they are just div tags with classes. I like to suggest using the actual header, main, and footer tags. </p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>It's nice that Page name not included in the header as per assignment. </p>

                            <p>It's very good that Main starts name of the page as an h2 and does not include name of site/brand as per assignment. </p>
